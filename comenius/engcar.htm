    <p><u>GENERAL</u></font><font FACE="Arial"></p>
    <p><small>The project concerns work placements, typically of 4 -5 weeks duration, which
    will not necessarily count towards any exam qualifications. Longer qualifying placements,
    perhaps entitled: </i>Work placements in partner countries: the exact nature of a
    qualifying placement,<i> could be considered in a third European project i.e. L</i>eonardo.</small></p>
    <p><small>&nbsp;</small><i></p>
    <p><small>These 4 -week placements represent an intermediate phase before
    the&quot;qualifying&quot; </i>Leonardo<i> placement; should the required duration of 4 - 5
    weeks prove an obstacle, a shorter placement could be considered.</small></p>
    <p><small>The placement proper will be preceded by a settling-in period at the receiving
    educational establishment, led by a tutor from the receiving establishment who speaks the
    placement student&#146;s mother tongue, or, should this not prove practicable, possibly by
    a student tutor / &quot;buddy&quot;.</small></p>

    <p><u>ELIGIBILTY</u></font><font FACE="Arial"></p>
    <p><small>These placements will be open to students on vocational courses, preferably
    those who have completed an initial period of work placement, of at least 4 weeks&#146;
    duration, in their home country; their suitability for an overseas placement will be
    assessed on completion of this first placement period. The student will already have a
    basic background knowledge of the profession in question...and will demonstrate specific
    qualities determined and assessed by course tutors. The student should preferably have
    reached the age of consent, i.e. 18 years.</small></p>

    work required from the three establishments involved.</small></p>
